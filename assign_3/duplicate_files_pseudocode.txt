step 16
Step 15: if previous_id is greater than file_id, set previous_id to file_id,
Step 16: increment j with 1
Step 17: if j is less than numberOfFiles, go back to step 10
Step 18: increment i with 1
Step 19: if i is less than numberOfTestCases, go back to step 7
Step 20: Close file
Step 21: Stop
