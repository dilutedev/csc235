Step 1: Start
Step 2: READ “file.in” file
Step 3: Check if file is empty
Step 4: DECLARE numberOfTestCases
Step 5: Read first line of file and initialize numberOfTestCases to first line
Step 6: Loop over the numberOfTestCases
Step 7: DECLARE variable to store number
Step 8: Read the next line of the file and initialize number to that line
Step 9: Check length of number
Step 10: DECLARE and initialize variable i to 0
Step 11: Start loop
Step 12: DECLARE and initialize count to 0
Step 13: DECLARE and initialize numOfOccurence to index i of number
Step 14: Loop over number
Step 15: Count how many times a digit occurs in the number
Step 16: Increment count
Step 17: If count is not equal to numOfOccurence, number is not a self
describing number
Step 18: DISPLAY “Not self-describing”
Step 19: If i is less than length, go back to step 12
Step 20:  DISPLAY “Self-describing”
Step 21: Stop
